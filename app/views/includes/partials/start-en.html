<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Electronic visa waiver</h1>

<p>You don’t need a visa for a visit to the UK of up to 6 months if you hold a passport of one of the following countries:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>Kuwait</li>
  <li>Oman</li>
  <li>Qatar</li>
  <li>United Arab Emirates</li>
</ul>
<p>If you hold one of these passports, you can complete a simple online form to get permission to visit the UK. This is a free service known as an electronic visa waiver (EVW).</p>
<p>You can use an EVW to visit the UK once, for up to 6 months. If you want to make multiple trips to the UK, you must complete an EVW for each visit.</p>
<p> You can use an EVW to visit for:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>tourism</li>
  <li>a business trip</li>
  <li>study</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot use an EVW to:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>work</li>
  <li>get married or enter into a civil partnership in the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>You must upload a scan of your passport in the online form. You don’t have to provide biometrics or visit a visa application centre.</p>
<p>To complete the form, you will need:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>your current passport</li>
  <li>an address in the UK where you will be staying</li>
  <li>details of your journey to and from the UK (including departure and arrival dates and times)</li>
</ul>
<p>You must complete the online form at least 48 hours before your trip to the UK.</p>
<p>If you are travelling in a group, each group member must get an EVW for the trip.</p>
