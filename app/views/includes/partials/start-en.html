<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Electronic visa waiver</h1>

<p>You don’t need a visa to visit the UK for up to 6 months if your visit is for:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>tourism</li>
  <li>a business trip</li>
  <li>study</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, you can get a free electronic visa waiver (EVW). You must get a new EVW every time you visit the UK, and you can’t use one to:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>work</li>
  <li>get married or enter into a civil partnership in the UK</li>
</ul>
<p class="panel-indent">You have to make a separate online EVW application for each person travelling, including children.</p>
<p class="bold-medium">How to get an EVW</p>
<p>Getting an EVW is not like getting a regular UK visa. You just need to complete the online form and won’t need to visit a visa application centre or pay a fee.</p>
<p class="panel-indent">You must complete the form <span class="bold-small">at least</span> 48 hours before your trip to the UK.</p>
<p>Before you start the form, make sure you have:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>your current passport</li>
  <li>an address in the UK where you will be staying</li>
  <li>details of your journey to and from the UK (including departure and arrival dates and times)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then complete the following simple steps:</p>

<dl class="evw-list">
  <dt>Fill in all the details in the form, upload a image of your passport photo page and sign the online declaration. The details you enter must exactly match with what is written in your passport and your travel details must be correct. Otherwise you risk not being allowed to travel. It is okay for someone else to fill in the form on your behalf, but they will have to give their contact details as well as yours.</dt>
  <dt>Within 24 hours you should be sent an email with a link to download your EVW. You can print out your EVW or keep it on your smartphone or tablet.</dt>
  <dt>Check your EVW to make sure the details are correct. You must contact us to get anything corrected at least 48 hours before travelling.</dt>
  <dt>You will need to show your EVW when you get on your plane, train or boat to the UK and also when you arrive at UK immigration controls.</dt>
