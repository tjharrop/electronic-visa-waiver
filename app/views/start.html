	<p>If you have a passport from Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait or Oman you can use this service to apply for an electronic visa waiver (EVW) to travel to the UK.</p>

	<p>You need to carefully complete an EVW application at least 48 hours before you travel to the UK.</p>
	<p>The personal details you provide in your EVW application must match those in your passport exactly.</p>
